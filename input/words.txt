It was great talking to Jeff Veis, S.V.P., CMO, Dave Postle, Global Head of Services, and John Bard, Director of Product Marketing at Actian. They are focused on providing an easy-to-integrate solution for developers to use in data management, integration, and analytics with APIs and open interfaces. According to Jeff, "Analytics are eating software and shifting how people think about computing."

Actian has just introduced Actian X to unify diverse data across the enterprise. Actian X is the first native and hybrid database that combines the power of the proven Actian Ingres OLTP database with Actian’s industry leading Vector analytics query engine to deliver high-speed performance and scalability critical to powering next generation digital enterprises. 

While the industry talks about hybrid deployment models, today’s transactional, operational, and analytic data is typically managed in silos, limiting performance and actionable insights. Traditional solutions from established providers usually feature monolithic platforms that increase complexity, cost, and lock-in without delivering the promised performance or insight. Actian X and Actian DataConnect 11 integration offerings deliver solutions specifically designed to meet the demands of today’s hybrid data-driven enterprise.
